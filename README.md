Intro

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This project introduces media query and how to implement it within the different screen sizes. Figma is also being used in this project in order to gain "real life" knowlege and experience on how the workforce will be. I plan to tackle this project to the best of my abilities and to learn and retain as much information as possible so I am ready for all of the wonders of Software Engineering that'll be coming my way!
